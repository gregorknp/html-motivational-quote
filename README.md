This is my first project uploaded to GitHub!

I'm just an HTML learner so I enrolled in the "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"
Udemy couse. This is final project of the CSS properties section.

Things we learn here:
- Create an HTML boilerplate in vs code.
- Steps to follow in order to allow us to use a particular font family in our code.
- Group some html elements inside a div tag to act as a container so these elements share the same box model.
- Style html elements using an external ccs file.
- Link the ccs file in the html code.
